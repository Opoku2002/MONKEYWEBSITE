 <P> <h3> Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Wildlife Sanctuary is found at Boaben <br>and Fiema, twin communities 22 kilometers away from the Nkoranza <br>
    North District of the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana. The 4.4 kilometer <br>square (kmÂ²) forest, believed to have been created in the 1970s, houses <br>
    many trees, birds, reptiles, deer and monkeys. It is a home for about 700 <br>monkeys. The village is a community where monkeys and human beings 
    <br>live together.The inhabitants in the village always leave food outside their <br>homes for the animals. The monkeys see human beings as their own.
    The<br> monkeys in the sanctuary are protected by the traditional laws on the area.<br> The sanctuary serves as a national tourist site and is accessible by road.</h3>
